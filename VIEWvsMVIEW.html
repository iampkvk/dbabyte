<h1>Views vs Materialized Views</h1>
<p>In Oracle databases, both views and materialized views are used to simplify complex queries and provide a way to represent data, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here's a detailed comparison:</p>

<h2>Views</h2>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>A view is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SELECT query. It does not store the data physically; instead, it retrieves data from the underlying tables each time it is queried.</p>

<h3>Characteristics</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Retrieval:</strong> A view does not contain data; it retrieves data from the base tables when queried.</li>
    <li><strong>Up-to-date:</strong> Always reflects the current data in the underlying tables because it fetches data dynamically.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Generally faster for simple queries, but can be slow for complex queries with many joins or aggregations, as it executes the underlying query each time.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> No additional storage required since it doesnâ€™t store data.</li>
    <li><strong>Read-Only or Updatable:</strong> Depending on the SQL used in the view definition, a view can be read-only or updatable (if it meets certain criteria).</li>
    <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Useful for simplifying complex queries, restricting data access, or presenting data in a specific format.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><code>CREATE VIEW employee_view AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 10;</code></pre>

<h2>Materialized Views</h2>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>A materialized view is a database object that stores the result of a query physically. It can be refreshed periodically or on demand, providing a snapshot of the data at the time of the last refresh.</p>

<h3>Characteristics</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Storage:</strong> Physically stores data based on the query results, which can improve performance for complex queries.</li>
    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Faster for read operations since it retrieves precomputed data rather than querying the base tables each time.</li>
    <li><strong>Refresh Options:</strong> Can be refreshed automatically (incrementally or completely) or manually, depending on how it's configured.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage Requirement:</strong> Requires additional storage since it stores a copy of the data.</li>
    <li><strong>Use Cases:</strong> Useful for reporting, data warehousing, and situations where query performance needs to be improved for complex aggregations or joins.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example</h3>
<pre><code>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_mview AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 10;</code></pre>

<h3>Refreshing a Materialized View</h3>
<pre><code>-- To refresh the materialized view manually
EXECUTE DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH('employee_mview');

-- To create a materialized view with automatic refresh every hour
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_mview
REFRESH EVERY INTERVAL '1' HOUR AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = 10;</code></pre>

<h2>Key Differences</h2>

            <th>Feature</th>
            <th>View</th>
            <th>Materialized View</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

        <tr>
            <td>Data Storage</td>
            <td>No physical storage</td>
            <td>Physically stores data</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Data Freshness</td>
            <td>Always up-to-date</td>
            <td>May become stale; needs refresh</td>
        </tr>

            <td>Performance</td>
            <td>Can be slower for complex queries</td>
            <td>Faster for complex queries due to precomputed data</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Refresh Mechanism</td>
            <td>Dynamic (no manual refresh)</td>
            <td>Requires manual or scheduled refresh</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Use Cases</td>
            <td>Simplifying queries, security</td>
            <td>Reporting, data warehousing</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use Views when you need real-time data access without storage overhead, and when you want to simplify complex queries or enforce security.</li>
    <li>Use Materialized Views when you need to improve query performance for complex aggregations or reporting, and you can tolerate some latency in data freshness.</li>
</ul>

<p>Choosing between views and materialized views depends on your specific use case, data access patterns, and performance requirements.</p>
